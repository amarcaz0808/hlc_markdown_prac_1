# hlc_markdown_prac_1
Hi I'm Álvaro Márquez Cazorla and I'm gonna mess with you by talking in English, gotta take advantage of my bilinguism somehow right?

This is the README markdown file, the main focus of this practice.
Now, all of this explaining is kind of pointless, don't you think?
Let's get down to what I should be doing instead of sort of losing time explaining in excruciating detail what this is.

# PROJECT: hlc_markdown_prac_01
## DESCRIPTION: Just testing using markdown files, those that have ".md" as their extension.
## CONTENT: This project has all you'd think you'd need, that being...
    1. A folder with some old Java project;
    2. Another folder with the executable file of said project;
    3. An informative document about what the hell that is about (along a javadoc file);
    4. A folder including a usability manual;
    5. And this very file!
## Everything rather simple stuff, all that's important is THIS very file, the README.md file.
## DEVELOPMENT: This was all made by me, Álvaro Márquez Cazorla (every project is made by one single person when it comes to this very exercise, after all).
## DEPLOYABLE: The 2 ways to execute the project in Windows.
    - Windows (graphically):
        - Simple as finding the folder you have the executable in and running it, be it double click or right click then choosing to Run it
    - Windows (Command Line):
        - Honestly if you're trying to run it on CMD you may already know better than I do, but just "java (path to executable)" and you're done.
## BUILT WITH: The project? Eclipse IDE. This README.md? Straight from GitHub, no need to use any app or extension to write these (although they ARE convenient).
## VERSION: 1.0 I guess? It doesn't matter in this case.
## DEVELOPERS: Just me, Álvaro Márquez Cazorla.
## LICENSE: I gave it to myself, and both Eclipse IDE and GitHub are free to use so it's your guess.
## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:
    - Link to GitHub: None, you're already here, but actually have it
        - https://github.com/amarcaz0808/hlc_markdown_prac_1
    - Nothing else, go have some snack or something but definitely drink some water.
